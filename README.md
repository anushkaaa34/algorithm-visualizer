Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive way and platform that visualize the algorithms in four main domain i.e. Trie data structure, Binary Search Tree, Path Finding and Sort Visual algorithm. 
The project focuses on visualizng ðŸ“Š the algorithm and try to make easier to understand and learn the algorithm.

features:
Step-by-step animation of the algorithm
Ability to pause animation
a short information on each algorithms and data structures
